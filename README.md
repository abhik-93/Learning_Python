# Learning Python is Fun!

This is my journey in learning Python. I will try to learn from different sources and divide the code according to the
sources I learn.

I use VS Code, PyCharm and Jupyter to code majorly.

Also one more important point to note, I try to comment my code in a clean way, so that I or anyone can understand
exactly what is going on in the code. In case, you still don't get it, 
feel free to contact me in my linkedin(linkedin.com/in/abhikch). :)
